# Executor框架

工作单元与执行机制分离开来

工作单元包括Runnable和Callable
执行机制由Executor框架提供

Executor负责上层的调度

## Executor框架结构

1. 任务 包括被执行任务需要实现的接口，Runnable接口或者Callable接口
2. 任务的执行 包括任务执行机制的核心接口Executor，以及继承自Executor的ExecutorService接口。Executor框架有两个关键类实现了ExecutorService接口(ThreadPoolExecutor和ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor)
3. 异步计算的结果。 包括接口Future和实现Future接口的FutureTask类

## Executor框架成员

### Executors

### ThreadPoolExecutor

Executors可创建三种类型的ThreadPoolExecutor

FixThreadPool 线程数目固定
`public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)

SingleThreadExecutor 单个线程

CacheThreadPool 根据需求创建新线程(大小无界的线程池)

### ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

Executors创建两种类型ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
SingleThreadScheduledExecutor

### Future接口

A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Methods are provided to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation. The result can only be retrieved using method get when the computation has completed, blocking if necessary until it is ready. Cancellation is performed by the cancel method. Additional methods are provided to determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled. If you would like to use a Future for the sake of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can declare types of the form Future<?> and return null as a result of the underlying task.

#### Sample Usage

 
```java

interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 class App {
   ExecutorService executor = ...
   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
   void showSearch(final String target)
       throws InterruptedException {
     Future<String> future
       = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() {
         public String call() {
             return searcher.search(target);
         }});
     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
     try {
       displayText(future.get()); // use future
     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
   }
 }
```
The FutureTask class is an implementation of Future that implements Runnable, and so may be executed by an Executor. For example, the above construction with submit could be replaced by:
 

```java
 FutureTask<String> future =
   new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() {
     public String call() {
       return searcher.search(target);
   }});
```
 executor.execute(future);
Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation happen-before actions following the corresponding Future.get() in another thread.

#### Method Summary
![](http://ok17kve7y.bkt.clouddn.com//15016669796787.jpg)


Future接口和实现Future接口的FutureTask类表示异步计算的结果。当我们把Runnable 接口或Callable接口的实现类提交（submit）给ThreadPoolExecutor或 ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor时，ThreadPoolExecutor或ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor会向我们 返回一个FutureTask对象。

#### Runable接口和Callable接口

Runnable接口和Callable接口的实现类，都可以被ThreadPoolExecutor或Scheduled- ThreadPoolExecutor执行。它们之间的区别是Runnable不会返回结果，而Callable可以返回结果。

1. 如果当前线程小于corePoolSize，则创建新线程来执行新任务(需获取全局锁)
2. 如果运行线程多余corePoolSize，则将任务加入BlockingQueue
3. 如果没法加入BlockingQueue(队列已满),则创建新的线程处理任务(获取全局锁)
4. 如果创建新线程将当前运行线程超过maximumPoolSize，任务将被拒绝，并调用RejectedExecutionHandler.rejectedExecution()方法



## Callable

A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.Implementors define a single method with no arguments called

 
The  `Callable` interface is similar to `java.lang.Runnable`, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A `Runnable`, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception.
 
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Callable<V> {
    /**
     * Computes a result, or throws an exception if unable to do so.
     *
     * @return computed result
     * @throws Exception if unable to compute a result
     */
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```


## Executor

![](http://ok17kve7y.bkt.clouddn.com//15016628826902.jpg)

### 介绍

An object that executes submitted Runnable tasks. This interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread use, scheduling, etc. An Executor is normally used instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than invoking new `Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()` for each of a set of tasks, you might use:

```java
 Executor executor = anExecutor;
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
```
 ...
 
However, the Executor interface does not strictly require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's thread:
 

```java
 class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     r.run();
   }
 }
```

More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other than the caller's thread. The executor below spawns a new thread for each task.
 

```java
 class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     new Thread(r).start();
   }
 }
```
Many Executor implementations impose some sort of limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled. The executor below serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor, illustrating a composite executor.
 

```java
class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
   final Queue<Runnable> tasks = new ArrayDeque<Runnable>();
   final Executor executor;
   Runnable active;

   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
     this.executor = executor;
   }

   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
     tasks.offer(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
         try {
           r.run();
         } finally {
           scheduleNext();
         }
       }
     });
     if (active == null) {
       scheduleNext();
     }
   }

   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
       executor.execute(active);
     }
   }
 }
```
The Executor implementations provided in this package implement ExecutorService, which is a more extensive interface. The ThreadPoolExecutor class provides an extensible thread pool implementation. The Executors class provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.
Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to submitting a Runnable object to an Executor happen-before its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.

## ExecutorService

![](http://ok17kve7y.bkt.clouddn.com//15016632955880.jpg)

### 介绍

An Executor that provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.
An ExecutorService can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks. Two different methods are provided for shutting down an ExecutorService. The shutdown() method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating, while the shutdownNow() method prevents waiting tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks. Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted. An unused ExecutorService should be shut down to allow reclamation of its resources.

Method submit extends base method Executor.execute(Runnable) by creating and returning a Future that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion. Methods invokeAny and invokeAll perform the most commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to complete. (Class ExecutorCompletionService can be used to write customized variants of these methods.)

The Executors class provides factory methods for the executor services provided in this package.

### Usage Examples

Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int) factory method:
 

```java
 class NetworkService implements Runnable {
   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
   private final ExecutorService pool;

   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
       throws IOException {
     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
   }

   public void run() { // run the service
     try {
       for (;;) {
         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
       }
     } catch (IOException ex) {
       pool.shutdown();
     }
   }
 }

 class Handler implements Runnable {
   private final Socket socket;
   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
   public void run() {
     // read and service request on socket
   }
 }
```

The following method shuts down an ExecutorService in two phases, first by calling shutdown to reject incoming tasks, and then calling shutdownNow, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
 

```java
 void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
   try {
     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
     }
   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
     pool.shutdownNow();
     // Preserve interrupt status
     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
   }
 }
```

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the submission of a Runnable or Callable task to an ExecutorService happen-before any actions taken by that task, which in turn happen-before the result is retrieved via Future.get().
